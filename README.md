The Project Service is responsible for managing projects and their associated resources. It handles operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and linking resources to projects.

## Architecture

The Project Service is built with a layered architecture:


**1. API Gateway**
*   **API Gateway:** The API Gateway acts as a central entry point for all requests to the Project Service. It performs tasks like request routing, authentication, rate limiting, and API versioning.

**2. Authorization**
*   **Authorization:** This component ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources. It enforces access control policies based on user roles and permissions.

**3. Project Service**
*   **Project API:** The Project API defines the public interface for interacting with the Project Service. It exposes endpoints for operations like creating, updating, and retrieving projects.
*   **Project Business Logic:** The Project Business Logic implements the core business rules and logic for managing projects. It handles tasks such as validating data, generating unique identifiers, and applying business constraints.

**4. Data Storage**
*   **Project Repository:** The Project Repository stores project data in a persistent manner, typically in a database.
*   **Project Resources:** This component manages the resources associated with a project. It handles operations such as linking resources to projects, managing resource permissions, and retrieving resource details.

## Operations

The Project Service supports the following operations:

*   **Create Project:** Creates a new project.
*   **Update Project:** Modifies an existing project.
*   **Delete Project:** Removes a project and its associated resources.
*   **Link Resources:** Associates resources with a project.
*   **Search Projects:** Retrieves projects based on specified criteria.
*   **Fetch Repos:** Retrieves data from external repositories, such as GitHub, and links them to projects.

## External Services

The Project Service interacts with the following external services:

*   **User Service:** Retrieves user information and verifies user permissions.
*   **Resource Service:** Manages resources
